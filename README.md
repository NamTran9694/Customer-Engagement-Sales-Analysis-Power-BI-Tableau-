CORRELATION MATRIX: The correlation coefficient between sales and others indicators of email measure are too small, nearly equal 0. This shows no effects of email marketing on sales.

RECOMMENDATION:
The email marketing perform poorly to increase sales. It could be many reasons for this. This could be the advertisement did not be attractive, or approach wrong targeted customers, or the incompletely email sent processing.
To increase sales, we could use another type of marketing instead of email. Beside that, we could give more promotions in February and September to attract more sales on the low sale months.
